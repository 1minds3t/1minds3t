### About Me

I started my public coding journey on August 4th, 2025. In the short time since, I've gone from my first commit to building a Universal Runtime Engine that solves dependency conflicts across multiple Python versions and, soon, across all programming languages.

My focus is **[omnipkg](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg)**, but my philosophy is bigger: I believe in **hyper-velocity execution**. The barriers in software development are not fixed; they are waiting for someone with enough focus and drive to break them.

What others see as a decade-long problem, I see as a weekend challenge.
